        <h3><strong>Step-By-Step</strong></h3>

            <li>Mix everything gently with your hands</li>
            <li>Knead until it becomes smooth and cohesive!</li>
            <li>Shape it into a ball and wrap it in plastic wrap</li>
            <li>Let it rest for about 30 minutes</li>
            <li>Cut it into 4 slices</li>
            <li>Use a rolling pin (or your hands!) to flatten it into an oval disk</li>
            <li>Run it through the widest setting of your pasta maker</li>
            <li>Fold the dough into a rectangle and then run it on your desired thickness</li>
            <li>Then finally, cut and cook it!</li>
